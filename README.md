This repository includes the files used to obtain the results (also here included) of our work "A catalogue of the projected rotational velocity if the CARMENES M-dwarf sample and the effect of limb darkening" that we are about to submit to the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal. 

The files todo_*.bash include the commands used to reduce all the CARMENES-VIS spectra to compute the vsini values, either with oversampled convolution (oc) or with numerical integration (ni). The *_nans.bash include some targets with exceptions to the previous rules. The version of serval we used is also uploaded here, serval_vsini_ld.py, that includes the option to compute the vsini either with OC or NI. The limb dakening coefficients for each spectral order needed for the computation are in ld_coefficients for Teff = 2500, 3000, 3500, and 4000 K. The .csv files include the results for 393 M-dwars of the CARMENES sample
